# Bashrc

This is for use in sh-based (Ubuntu, Debian, Alpine, etc.) environments. 

Place the contents of this file in  `/root`.

When using in projects using the microservice setup, I recommend **copying the folder directly** and removing all 
git-related files instead of 
using a 
submodule so as not to affect the main repo.
